## About The Project

**ConsoleFlow** is not just another web browser. It is built specifically for web developers who need to debug websites on mobile devices. By intercepting web requests using `OkHttp`, ConsoleFlow automatically injects [Eruda](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda) (a mobile web console) into web pages, allowing you to view console logs, inspect DOM elements, check network requests, and execute JavaScript right from your Android phone.

## Features

- **Auto-Injected Web Console:** Automatically injects Eruda into web pages for seamless mobile debugging.
- **Smart Interception (Anti-CAPTCHA):** Bypasses interception for major search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) to prevent annoying CAPTCHAs.
- **Desktop Mode:** One-tap switch to a real desktop user agent and viewport.
- **Custom JS Injection:** Add your own custom JavaScript to be executed automatically on every page load.
- **Find in Page:** Easily search for specific text within any webpage.
- **Bookmarks & History:** Built-in local storage manager for your favorite sites and browsing history.
- **Native Downloads:** Integrated with Android's native `DownloadManager` for stable file downloading.
- **Sleek UI:** Custom dark-themed start page, error pages, menus, and Android 12+ Splash Screen support.

## Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Network Interception:** OkHttp3
- **Web Rendering:** android.webkit.WebView
- **UI Components:** AndroidX, Material Design Components, SwipeRefreshLayout
- **Dev Tools:** Eruda (Local Asset)

## Installation

ConsoleFlow is ready to use right out of the box. 

### System Requirements
